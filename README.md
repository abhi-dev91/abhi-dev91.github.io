Hello there! I am a highly skilled DevOps engineer with a strong focus on automation and 1 year of experience in designing, implementing, and managing infrastructure for various applications. I have recently built an end-to-end automation framework using a combination of Helm, Terraform, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Git, and Python, resulting in the ability to deliver applications within just 7 days!

My expertise lies in cloud technologies such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as containerization platforms like Docker and Kubernetes. I am proficient in configuring and managing infrastructure using tools such as Ansible, Terraform, and Jenkins, and am experienced in automating processes using Python.

I am a self-starter, quick learner, and highly adaptable to new technologies and methodologies. I thrive in collaborative environments and believe that communication is key to delivering successful projects. I am always looking for opportunities to improve my skills and contribute to open-source projects.

If you're looking for a DevOps engineer who can streamline your application delivery process and help you achieve faster time-to-market, then I am the person for you!
